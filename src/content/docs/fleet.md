# Fleets

A fleet is a reusable, shareable orchestration: named **teams** of agents with
pre-assigned **skills**, bound to a delegation mode, run by one command. The
orchestrator session routes work — deliberation happens in roundtable rooms,
execution fans out through subagents — and every seat runs on a model from the
subscriptions you actually have configured.

One blueprint file is the whole artifact. Share a fleet by sharing the file.

## Quickstart

```
/fleetsetup
```

The session interviews you — outcome, teams, members, models — and writes
`.orphus/fleets/<name>.fleet.yaml`, validating as it goes. Model seats are
offered **only from configured providers** (the same auth the `/login` screen
shows); if you want a provider that isn't configured, run `/login <provider>`
first.

```
/fleet                       # list blueprints
/fleet coding-team add a --version flag to the exporter
/fleet validate coding-team  # check without running
```

Running a fleet pins the blueprint's orchestrator model (if declared), names
the session, and hands the model the fleet's facts plus the
`fleet-orchestration` skill. From there the orchestrator routes: it does not
write the code itself.

## Blueprints

```yaml
name: coding-team
description: Design deliberation, bounded dispatch, adversarial review.
orchestrator:
  model: anthropic/claude-opus     # optional — your choice at setup, never assumed.
                                   # A :high-style thinking suffix is accepted and applied
                                   # as the orchestrator session's thinking level.
teams:
  design:
    mode: deliberate               # debate in a room, converge on FINAL: lines
    rounds: 2
    members:
      - agent: codebase-analyzer
      - agent: worker
        brief: Argue for the smallest change that works.
  implementation:
    mode: dispatch                 # parallel bounded tasks, results return
    skills: [tdd]                  # team skills union into every member
    group: true
    members:
      - agent: worker
        count: 2
pipeline: [design, implementation]
```

Members reference agent definitions by runtime name — the agent file keeps
ownership of tools, prompts, and model ladders; the blueprint adds team
structure, briefs, and skill assignments on top. Three modes: `dispatch`,
`deliberate`, and `deliberate-then-dispatch` (decide in a room, then execute
the decision). The full field reference ships as `SCHEMA.md` in the fleet
package, and seven example blueprints (coding, design, council, research,
docs/release, media via Kie.ai, and a blog pipeline) ship in its `examples/`.

Blueprints live in `.orphus/fleets/` (project) and `<agentDir>/fleets/`
(user); project shadows user, and the seven shipped examples are always
discoverable as a third, lowest-precedence `bundled` scope — so `/fleet` works
out of the box, and copying an example into a project or user dir (or letting
`/fleetsetup` start from one) overrides it by name. The `fleet` tool gives the model
`list`/`get`/`validate` over them — `validate` is the authoring loop's gate.

## The final gate

A blueprint can declare how PR-shaped work gets judged:

```yaml
gate:
  reviewers: [coderabbit]          # or greptile, or both — must COMPLETE first
  model: openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol  # renders the verdict once they have
```

The orchestrator waits for the named reviewers to finish, triages their
findings (fixing what is real, refuting what is not — with evidence), then
dispatches the gate model in fresh context for a pass / fix-first verdict.
Green checks alone never merge. `/fleetsetup` asks about this during the
interview.

## Sharp edges

- A `skill` list on a dispatch call **replaces** the agent definition's own
  skills; blueprint unions are computed from the blueprint alone.
- Deliberate-team members need `roundtable` in their effective tool allowlist,
  and most read-only agents exclude it. Grant it per member in the blueprint —
  `tools: [read, search, find, ls, roundtable]` — which REPLACES the agent's
  own list for that seat. The shipped examples all carry the grant.
- Every member is a live model session; `count` and `concurrency` multiply
  real spend. The orchestration skill requires the model to state cost before
  large fan-outs, and caps retries at retry → diagnostic → human.
- The runtime can start each seat at its cheapest priced rung: `cheapestFirst: true`
  on a `subagent` call reorders the member's declared ladder by registry price and
  escalates on failure, and a `handoff` of decision, files, and acceptance
  criterion is what lets that rung succeed. See [Subagents](https://github.com/kelvincushman/orphus/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/subagents).

## Repo agent config — one blueprint, any repository

Blueprints are community artifacts and stay identical everywhere. Repo-specific
facts — where issues live, what triage labels are called, where domain docs sit
— belong in committed markdown under `docs/agents/`:

- `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` — tracker type and the exact commands or
  workflow agents should use (GitHub `gh`, GitLab `glab`, local markdown, or a
  prose description of Jira/Linear/anything else)
- `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` — canonical label names mapped to this repo's
- `docs/agents/domain.md` — the domain-documentation layout

`/fleetsetup` asks one question and writes `issue-tracker.md` when it is
missing (proposing the tracker that matches the git remote). `/fleet` runs
reference whichever of these files exist — nothing is inlined; the orchestrator
reads them lazily and passes the instruction to members whose tasks touch those
surfaces. The convention is shared with community skill packs
([mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) reads the same
files), so one configuration serves fleets and skills alike. Install such packs
with `orphus install <repo-url>`; their skills surface lazily like any other.
