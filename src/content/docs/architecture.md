# Architecture

How the context-window bound is actually enforced, what runs where, and which
guarantees are real versus conventional. For the design rationale behind these
choices — the alternatives considered and rejected — see

```

Each agent is an ordinary Orphus session. The broker is a separate process
holding all room state. Nothing about the discussion is replicated into a
session's transcript except what that session explicitly pulls.

The asymmetry is the product: open any agent's transcript during a live
discussion and you find a handful of one-line pings and a few small digests,
while the room holds the whole deliberation.

## The broker

A single-process room server on a local socket under the agent directory
(`~/.orphus/agent/roundtable/broker.sock`, or a named pipe on Windows). One per
agent directory.

**It starts itself.** The first session to use the tool spawns a detached
broker. There is no daemon to install and no start command in any workflow.

**It exits when idle** — five seconds after the last session disconnects. Rooms
are in-memory, so they go with it. Only a broker that owns its own process may
exit it; one embedded in a test or a demo shuts down without taking its host
down, which is a distinction the code makes explicitly.

**Startup resolves contention through the socket, not a lock file.** Several
sessions starting at once — the normal case for `orphus-roles --format tmux | sh`
— all try to spawn. Before reclaiming a socket path, a broker checks whether
something is already answering on it. If so it stands down; if the path is
stale, it reclaims it. The residual race, where two brokers probe in the same
instant, resolves at `listen()` when the loser gets `EADDRINUSE`.

The pid file is diagnostic only, and deliberately not the lock: pids are reused,
and a lock file cannot say whether its holder is still *serving*. The socket
answers exactly that question, so the socket is the lock.

**Room state** is a ring buffer of 500 messages per room, plus members and a
cursor per role name. Sequence numbers are monotonic per room and never reused,
which is what makes `afterSeq` stable across rotation.

## The wire

Length-prefixed JSON: a 4-byte big-endian length, then the payload. The framing
deliberately mirrors `@orphus/intercom`'s so the two brokers stay
protocol-cousins and a future merge stays cheap.

The reader buffers across socket reads, so a message split arbitrarily — even
with its length header arriving in pieces — reassembles correctly. A malformed
payload stops the batch rather than skipping to the next message: once framing
is untrustworthy, everything behind it is suspect, and the broker destroys that
connection.

## The extension

`packages/roundtable/index.ts` is loaded as a builtin, so every session
registers `roundtable` and `memory` without configuration.

The builtin is no longer the only client. `orphus-roundtable-mcp` (in
`packages/roundtable/bin/`) is a stdio MCP server wrapping the same tool logic
and the same broker client, so external agent CLIs — Claude Code, Codex,
Gemini CLI — can sit in a room next to Orphus-hosted roles. It pins its role at
launch (`--as`), ensures the broker itself since no session will, and has no
push channel, so external peers poll digests. See
[the tool reference](/docs/roundtable-tool#external-peers-over-mcp).

**The connection is lazy.** A session that never touches a room never connects
and never spawns a broker — an idle session pays nothing. Concurrent first calls
are serialized behind a single in-flight promise, because the harness runs tools
in parallel and two simultaneous calls would otherwise create two clients, one
orphaned and still firing events.

**Pings are coalesced** over a 1.5-second window: counts and author names per
room, one message per quiet period, no bodies. Events carrying sequence zero are
membership churn and are filtered out before they can be mistaken for content.

## What the bound guarantees

Precisely, so you know what you can rely on:

**Guaranteed.** A digest is at most `budget` characters plus one marker line.
This holds regardless of how many messages are unread, how long they are, or who
wrote them. The digest algorithm is deterministic and model-free, so the same
inputs always produce the same output, and no peer can influence the size of
yours by writing differently.

**Guaranteed.** Push delivery carries no message bodies. What arrives unasked is
a count and a set of author names.

**Not guaranteed.** That a digest contains what you needed. Budget is spent
newest-first, so conclusions survive and early exploration compresses — but if
the important thing is old, it will be a headline or a count. The collapse
marker tells you how many were dropped; `fetch` gets them back.

**Not a bound at all.** `fetch` returns what you ask for, in full. That tier
exists because the caller sometimes genuinely needs the text, and a small default
page size is the only guard.

## Boundaries and their bounds

The guarantees above describe one boundary. Orphus has several, and this table is
the honest scoreboard of which are actually bounded by the runtime today:

| Boundary | Bound today | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| room → agent | **Runtime-enforced** | Digest tiering: at most `budget` chars plus one marker line ([`digest.ts`](../packages/roundtable/digest.ts), default budget 2000, per-message cap 600) |
| subagent → parent (parallel) | **Runtime-enforced** *when artifact paths exist* | The same tiering as a room digest, through the same [`bounded-render.ts`](../packages/roundtable/bounded-render.ts) core: budget + one marker line, with each task's artifact path carried alongside. Failures are ordered first so a collapsed error is impossible. `inline` and `file-only` opt out per call, and if any task lacks an artifact path nothing is bounded — see below |
| subagent → parent (single, chain) | Truncation only — 200 KB / 5000 lines | Still concatenated in full; the cap is `DEFAULT_MAX_OUTPUT` in [`types-runtime.ts`](../packages/subagents/src/shared/types-runtime.ts) |
| chain step → next step | **Runtime-enforced** *when an artifact path exists* | `{outputs.name}` splices a bounded rendering (2000 chars) plus the path to the full output, through the same `boundedRender` core ([`chain-outputs.ts`](../packages/subagents/src/runs/shared/chain-outputs.ts)). `{outputs.name.full}` is the explicit opt-out. With artifacts disabled there is nowhere to point, so the splice falls back to full text rather than discarding what it cannot relocate |
| tool result → context | Spill to file above 50 000 chars | `DEFAULT_MAX_RESULT_SIZE_CHARS` in [`tool-limits.ts`](../packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools/tool-limits.ts); the model receives a preview and a path |
| kernel → agent | **Bounded in memory; context bound is the spill above** | The kernel buffer retains the last 200 000 chars and returns at most 4 000 per view, counting elisions ([`kernel-output.ts`](../packages/coding-agent/src/core/repl/kernel-output.ts)). This is a *memory* bound on a process that prints forever; the context bound is the tool-result spill in the row above, which a `repl` tool gets by being an ordinary tool. The tool is registered behind `ORPHUS_ENABLE_REPL`, **default off** — see [`repl.md`](./repl.md) |

A parallel fan-out now bounds its return the way a room bounds a digest, and
through the same code: four children emitting 100 KB each reach the parent as
roughly 1.7 KB, every task still named and every one carrying the path to its
full output on disk. Failures sort first, so the one outcome a parent cannot
recover from — a silently collapsed error, leaving a summary that looks fine —
cannot be what gets dropped.

A chain step's splice was the weakest boundary of all — a step emitting 100 KB
put 100 KB straight into its successor's prompt, with nothing in between. It now
carries 2000 characters plus the path to the rest, and `{outputs.name.full}` is
there for the step that genuinely needs everything. That escape hatch matters:
bounding without one would have broken chains built when the splice was total.

**Both bounded subagent rows depend on an artifact path, and say so.** A bound
relocates content; it does not delete it. Artifacts are where the full output
goes, and they can be switched off — so when there is nowhere to point, neither
the parallel return nor the chain splice bounds anything. That is a deliberate
choice rather than an oversight: a bound that loses what it drops would be worse
than the truncation it replaced, because it would look like a guarantee.

The row still marked truncation-only is where the gap remains. Truncation is a
backstop, not a bound: a 200 KB cap fires far past the point where the parent's
context is the scarce resource, and it prevents catastrophe without shaping what
arrives.

When a later phase changes a row here, that diff is the release note.

## Trust boundary

**Local machine, same user.** The socket lives under the agent directory with
user-only permissions. Every session that can open it already runs as you, with
your permissions.

So a hostile same-user process is outside the model: it has a shell and does not
need the broker. What *is* in scope is anything that escapes the boundary — a
change that widens the socket beyond the local user, or a path by which a peer
could inflate your context past the digest bound.

Two things that look like security boundaries and are not:

- **The `librarian` write role** is a coordination convention. It is an
  in-process check on a role name, and it prevents *accidental* concurrent
  writes to shared memory, which is the real failure it exists to stop. Any
  same-user session could invoke the memory backend directly, so no in-process
  check could make it enforcement.
- **Prompt injection in a room message** is ordinary untrusted content. Room
  messages carry no capabilities — nothing a message can do except be read — and
  the dangerous verbs (spawning, supervising) live in intercom, not here.

Reporting: [`../SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md).

## Failure modes worth knowing

Two of these fail *silently*, which is why they are worth reading before you hit
them.

**Split fleet.** Sessions resolving different agent directories reach different
brokers and cannot see each other — with no error, because each is talking to a
perfectly healthy broker of its own. Symptom: peers post and nobody's unread
count moves. Fix: one `ORPHUS_CODING_AGENT_DIR` across the fleet.

**Empty memory store.** A memory query against a store nothing was ingested into
returns an empty answer and exits zero, which reads as success. `ORPHUS_MEMORY_DIR`
now defaults under the agent home specifically so worktrees converge without
configuration.

**Lost membership after a broker restart.** The broker exits five seconds after
the last session leaves. A session outliving it reconnects to a *new* broker
with no rooms, and the next post fails with `Not a member of room "…"; join it
first`. This one is loud and the message is the remedy. Replaying joins
automatically would be worse — it would restore the appearance of continuity
over a transcript that no longer exists.

**A role name that changes.** Cursors key on role name, so a session without a
stable `--name` falls back to `session-<pid>` and loses its read position on
every restart.

## Where Orphus ends and Atomic begins

Most of this repository is vendored upstream. What Orphus authors:

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/roundtable/` | Rooms, digest, broker, roles, memory adapter — everything above |
| `packages/fleet/` | Fleet blueprints, `/fleet` + `/fleetsetup`, the orchestration and kie-ai-media skills |
| `packages/transcribe/` | Local dictation, derived from pi-transcribe. Not bundled; fails closed until its natives are built |
| `packages/coding-agent/src/core/{capabilities,replay}/`, `.../core/provider-audit.ts`, `.../cli/inspect-runtime.ts`, `.../extensions/browser/`, `.../core/terminal/termdom-*` | The capability boundary, the provider/tool session records and replay harness, `orphus inspect runtime`, browser operation, and the termDOM backend — first-party, inside an otherwise vendored package |
| `test/unit/roundtable-*`, `test/unit/fleet-*`, `test/unit/{harness,browser,terminal,transcribe}-*` | Their tests |
| `docs/`, `roles/`, `orphus.roles.yaml` | This documentation and the example manifest |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | The gate that actually runs |

Everything else — the agent loop, providers, tools, MCP, subagents, workflows,
the TUI — comes from [Atomic](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic) and behaves
as it does upstream. A bug there is usually worth reporting upstream too.

Note that `packages/coding-agent/` is no longer wholly vendored: the rows above
name first-party subsystems living inside it. Check the row before assuming a
file there is upstream's.

The inherited `test.yml`, `publish.yml`, and `warm-toolchain-cache.yml` are all
**disabled**: they target Blacksmith runners registered to the upstream
organization, which never pick up jobs here. `publish.yml` and
`warm-toolchain-cache.yml` are kept byte-identical to upstream; `test.yml` is
not, because it carries the rebrand's `ORPHUS_REQUIRE_*` env-var names. Read
them as a record of upstream's topology, not as this repository's CI. What runs
here is documented in [`ci.md`](ci.md).
