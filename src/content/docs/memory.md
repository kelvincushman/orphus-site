# Long-term memory: HMLR-Wiki / Dossier

Rooms are deliberately *ephemeral*: ring buffers, broker-side cursors, bounded
digests. That is working memory for a live deliberation, and it must stay small.
What Orphus does not get from rooms is durable knowledge — what past
deliberations concluded, what the retro loop learned, what the codebase's design
contracts actually say. That layer is
[HMLR-Wiki / Dossier](https://github.com/kelvincushman/HMLR-Wiki): a wiki-backed
memory system for LLM agents, built by Kelvin Lee on HMLR (Sean VanWinkle) and
Karpathy's LLM-Wiki pattern.

The two systems solve different problems and compose without overlap:

```
room transcript (ephemeral, broker)  ──after task──►  dossier ingest (durable, wiki)
agent needs history                  ──tool call───►  dossier query (explicit fetch)
```

## The contract

1. **Memory reads live in the explicit-fetch tier only.** Orphus's core claim is
   that what enters an agent's context is bounded by deterministic, model-free
   machinery. Dossier's retrieval is LLM-in-the-loop (extractors, rerankers, a
   sentence-level grounding filter) — powerful, but neither deterministic nor
   provably bounded. So memory content enters context only when an agent
   explicitly calls the memory tool, never via activity pings and never inside a
   digest. The provable-bound story stays clean.

2. **One writer: the `librarian` role — a coordination convention, not a
   security boundary.** Be precise about what this is: the gate is an in-process
   check comparing the session's role name to the configured writer role. It
   prevents *accidental* concurrent writes, which is the failure it exists to
   stop. It is not enforcement — any same-user session has a shell tool and could
   run `python -m dossier ingest` directly, so no in-process check could ever be
   a boundary. That is consistent with the project's stated trust model
   (local machine, same user), and building cross-process enforcement — writer
   leases, signed role tokens — would be hardening against an attacker who has
   already won. Concurrent agents writing shared memory
   is the classic failure mode (write contention, conflicting facts, unclear
   provenance). The role model already provides the answer: exactly one role
   owns `ingest` and the gardener/consolidation pass; every other role is
   read-only. This is a design rule, not new code — declare a `librarian` in
   `orphus.roles.yaml` when a task needs durable memory.

3. **Room transcripts are ingested post-task, not live.** When a room's task
   concludes, the librarian ingests the transcript as a raw source; Dossier's
   extractors compile it into entity/concept pages. Past deliberations become
   queryable without any agent ever holding them in context — the same
   asymmetry rooms provide, extended over time.

4. **Memory writes are diffs.** Dossier's store is markdown in git. Every
   ingest and every gardener pass is a reviewable diff, which is exactly the
   evidence-gated shape the self-improvement loop requires — retro agents in
   `#retro-<runId>` compile conclusions into wiki pages, and those page diffs
   are the book's evidence artifacts. See
   [self-improvement-loop.md](/docs/self-improvement-loop).

5. **Integration is a boundary, not a port.** Dossier is Python; Orphus is
   TypeScript. The tool shells out to the benchmarked implementation
   (`python -m dossier query|ingest|gardener`) rather than porting it — a port
   would drift from the code the RAGAS results were measured on.

## The tool (shipped)

`packages/roundtable/memory-tool.ts` registers a `memory` tool alongside
`roundtable`, wired in `packages/roundtable/index.ts`:

```typescript
memory({ action: "query",  question: "what did we decide about rate limiting?" })
memory({ action: "doctor" })                                        // is the backend reachable?
memory({ action: "ingest", source: "<path>" })                     // librarian only
memory({ action: "gardener" })                                     // librarian only
```

It shells out to the Dossier CLI, configured entirely by environment:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ORPHUS_MEMORY_COMMAND` | `python -m dossier` | Base command, split on whitespace |
| `ORPHUS_MEMORY_DIR` | `<agent dir>/memory` | Dossier project dir — where `raw/` and `wiki/` live; created on first use |
| `ORPHUS_MEMORY_WRITER_ROLE` | `librarian` | The one role allowed to write |

The design keeps the contract mechanical:

- **The gate runs before any subprocess.** `gateAction` in
  `packages/roundtable/memory/dossier.ts` decides read-vs-write purely from the
  action and the session's role (`pi.getSessionName()`); a non-writer is refused
  before Dossier is ever spawned.
- **argv is a real vector, never a shell string.** `runDossier` passes the
  question or source path as separate `spawn` arguments with no shell, so
  agent-supplied text is data, not a command — no injection surface.
- **Reads are inherently explicit-fetch.** A tool call is a deliberate act by
  the agent; nothing here pushes into a ping or a digest, so the bound holds.
- **A missing backend is a clear notice, not a crash.** If Dossier is not
  installed, the tool returns a "configure `ORPHUS_MEMORY_COMMAND`" message.

Ingest takes a file path (matching `python -m dossier ingest <path>`). To capture
a concluded room, the librarian exports it and then ingests that file — post-task,
never live:

```typescript
roundtable({ action: "export", room: "design", path: "raw/design.md" })
memory({ action: "ingest", source: "raw/design.md" })
```

The export path is relative to the shared memory project and must stay under its
`raw/` directory, so the following `memory ingest` resolves the same file in every
worktree. `export` goes broker → disk, deliberately bypassing the digest: a digest
collapses older messages, so a digest-derived file would be a lossy source for
permanent memory. It returns only the path and counts, so the transcript never
enters the librarian's context window, and it never touches read cursors —
exporting a room cannot steal another role's catch-up. Rooms retain 500 messages;
if earlier messages have rotated out, export reports the omitted count instead of
claiming the retained transcript is complete.

## What the benchmark does and does not show

Dossier's headline result: on HMLR's own Hydra9 Hard Mode (doc-variant), it
matches HMLR on faithfulness (1.000) and context recall (1.000) and exceeds it
on precision (0.938 vs 0.23). Stated honestly:

- The defensible headline is **faithfulness/recall parity with much higher
  precision**. The "+0.236 3-metric mean" is mostly that one anomalously low
  baseline precision number.
- RAGAS on Hydra9 measures **single-session retrieval QA**, not multi-agent
  memory semantics. Write contention, provenance, and staleness during live
  deliberation are addressed by the contract above (single writer, post-task
  ingest, explicit fetch) — by design, not by the benchmark.

## Why this over a hosted memory service

Local-first matches the broker's trust boundary (same machine, no cloud
dependency); the store is inspectable markdown rather than an opaque index; the
whole demo remains runnable offline on stage; and the bench harness is
reproducible (`pytest --run-bench`), so memory-layer changes can be gated on
measured evidence like everything else in Orphus.
