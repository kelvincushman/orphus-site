# Running Orphus under Orca

[Orca](https://github.com/stablyai/orca) orchestrates CLI agents in parallel
git worktrees and already ships a Pi integration (`src/main/pi/`). Orphus keeps
Atomic's Pi-compatible extension points, so it works with that integration as-is.

## Setup

1. Build the `orphus` binary from your checkout and put it on `PATH`, so Orca's
   lookup finds it:
   ```bash
   npm ci --ignore-scripts
   npm run build --workspace=@orphus/coding-agent
   mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
   ln -sf "$PWD/packages/coding-agent/dist/cli.js" "$HOME/.local/bin/orphus"
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
   command -v orphus
   ```
   Orphus is not published to npm, so there is no global install to run — see
   the README for the current install story.
2. In Orca, add the agent as a Pi-compatible CLI agent (Settings → Agents).
   Orca's Pi status extension reads the same session state files.
3. Launch multiple worktrees from one prompt as usual.

## Making Orca worktrees deliberate with each other

Orca runs each agent in its own worktree but on the same machine — which is
exactly roundtable's trust boundary. To have a fleet of Orca-spawned sessions
share a discussion room:

- Set a shared agent dir so all worktrees hit the same broker:
  `export ORPHUS_CODING_AGENT_DIR="$HOME/.orphus/agent"`.

  This step is load-bearing, and the value matters. The broker socket lives
  under the agent dir, so worktrees that resolve different agent dirs get
  different brokers and cannot see each other — with no error, because each one
  is talking to a perfectly healthy broker of its own. `~/.orphus/agent` is the
  default (`configDir: ".orphus"` in the coding-agent manifest), so exporting it
  is belt-and-braces rather than a change; `.atomic` is only a legacy fallback
  for existing installs and is *not* where a fresh checkout looks.
- Give each worktree a role name (`--name planner`, etc.) so cursors and
  attribution are stable. Without it the session falls back to `session-<pid>`
  and loses its cursor on restart.
- Prompt each agent to `join` the task room, e.g. `#orca-task-123`, post
  conclusions, and `digest` before major decisions.

Or declare the whole fleet once in [`orphus.roles.yaml`](../orphus.roles.yaml)
and let the launcher emit the Orca commands — one terminal per role, each in
whichever worktree that role selects:

```bash
orphus-roles --format orca | sh
```

```
orca terminal create --worktree 'name:planner' --title 'planner' --command 'orphus --name planner …'
```

Give a role its own checkout with `worktree: name:planner` in the manifest;
roles default to the `active` worktree. Create the worktrees first with
`orca worktree create --name <role>`. See [roles.md](/docs/roles).

The Orca UI shows each agent's own transcript; the shared discussion lives in
the broker and each transcript only ever contains that agent's bounded digests
— which is the point.

## Demo choreography (for the book / talks)

1. Open Orca, fan one prompt across three worktrees: planner, researcher, critic.
2. Prompt template per role: "Join roundtable room #design. Discuss the rate
   limiter design with your peers. Post conclusions, digest before deciding."
3. Show any agent's transcript: a handful of one-line activity pings and small
   digests — while the full discussion (visible via
   `bun packages/roundtable/demo/run-demo.ts`-style inspection or a `peek`)
   is far larger.
